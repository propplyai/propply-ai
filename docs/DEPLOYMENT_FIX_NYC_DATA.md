# NYC Property Data Fix - Deployment Update

## Problem Identified

When clicking on a property at https://agent4nyc.onrender.com/, the Property Analysis Results modal showed:
- ⚠️ "No Data Available"
- ⚠️ "Unable to load compliance data for this property"

## Root Causes

### 1. Missing Database Tables
The NYC property data tables were not created in Supabase:
- `nyc_properties` - Master table with BIN/BBL
- `nyc_dob_violations` - DOB violations
- `nyc_hpd_violations` - HPD violations  
- `nyc_elevator_inspections` - Elevator data
- `nyc_boiler_inspections` - Boiler data
- `nyc_311_complaints` - 311 complaints
- And 5 more tables...

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** - Migration applied successfully via MCP

### 2. Backend Not Running on Render
The `Procfile` was set to:
```
web: npm run serve
```

This only served the static React build files. The Flask backend with all `/api/` endpoints was never started!

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** - Updated to use Gunicorn

### 3. Conflicting Flask Routes
Old template-based routes were conflicting with the React SPA:
- `/` returned JSON API info instead of React app
- `/portfolio`, `/compliance`, etc. tried to render non-existent templates

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** - Removed conflicting routes, added proper catch-all

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema (Applied via MCP)
Created comprehensive NYC data tables with:
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Service role policies for backend access
- Proper indexes for performance
- Foreign key relationships
- Helper functions for compliance scoring

### 2. Procfile
**Before:**
```
web: npm run serve
```

**After:**
```
web: gunicorn propply_app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 4 --timeout 120
```

### 3. render.yaml
Updated start command to match Procfile:
```yaml
startCommand: gunicorn propply_app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 4 --timeout 120
```

### 4. propply_app.py
- ✅ Removed conflicting routes (`/`, `/portfolio`, `/compliance`, etc.)
- ✅ Moved API info to `/api/info`
- ✅ Added proper static file serving (`/static/<path>`)
- ✅ Improved catch-all route to serve React app
- ✅ Fixed 404 handler to serve React for non-API routes
- ✅ Updated error handlers to return JSON for API routes

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Push Changes to GitHub
```bash
cd /Users/art3a/dev/Propply_MVP
git add Procfile render.yaml propply_app.py
git commit -m "Fix: Enable Flask backend on Render and add NYC data tables"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Render will auto-deploy
Once pushed, Render will:
1. Build Python dependencies
2. Build React frontend
3. Start Gunicorn with Flask backend
4. Serve both API and React app

### Step 3: Test the Fix
1. Visit https://agent4nyc.onrender.com/
2. Log in and navigate to Properties
3. Click on "666 Broadway New York, NY 10012"
4. Click "Try Again" in the modal
5. Backend will:
   - Look up BIN number for the address
   - Fetch data from NYC Open Data APIs
   - Store in the new Supabase tables
   - Display compliance data

## Expected Results

After deployment, clicking on a property should show:

### ✅ Property Analysis Results Modal with:
- **Compliance Score** (0-100)
- **Risk Level** (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL)
- **DOB Violations** (Department of Buildings)
- **HPD Violations** (Housing Preservation)
- **Elevator Inspections** (with device numbers, dates, status)
- **Boiler Inspections** (with device numbers, dates, status)
- **311 Complaints** (citizen complaints)
- **Last Updated** timestamp

## API Endpoints Now Working

- ✅ `GET /api/health` - Health check
- ✅ `POST /api/property/search` - Search properties by address
- ✅ `POST /api/sync-nyc-property` - Sync NYC data
- ✅ `GET /api/nyc-property-data/<id>` - Get property compliance data
- ✅ All other API endpoints

## Testing Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] Homepage loads (React app)
- [ ] Login works
- [ ] Properties list displays
- [ ] Click on a property opens modal
- [ ] "Try Again" button syncs data
- [ ] Compliance data displays correctly
- [ ] Elevator/Boiler sections show data
- [ ] Violations display with proper formatting
- [ ] API endpoints return JSON (not HTML)

## Monitoring

Check logs on Render dashboard:
```
https://dashboard.render.com/
```

Look for:
- ✅ Gunicorn startup messages
- ✅ NYC data sync logs
- ✅ API request logs
- ⚠️ Any error messages

## Rollback Plan (if needed)

If issues occur:
1. In Render dashboard, revert to previous deployment
2. Or restore files:
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

## Notes

- **Database migrations are persistent** - The NYC tables are already created in Supabase
- **No environment variables needed to change**
- **Gunicorn is already in requirements.txt**
- **React build files are already in /build**

## Next Steps

1. Commit and push changes
2. Wait for Render deployment (~5-10 minutes)
3. Test the property detail modal
4. Monitor logs for any issues
5. If successful, update properties with BIN numbers via search API
